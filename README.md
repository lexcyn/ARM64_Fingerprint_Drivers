# ARM64 Fingerprint Drivers

A repo to store any Windows ARM64 fingerprint reader drivers since it took me ages to find them. Hopefully this will help some people.

Note that these drivers may need to be 'forced' installed, which means you will need to use Device Manager and manually install them. You may also receive a warning saying the drivers are not the correct version, but in most cases, you can ignore this message. A reboot will be needed to initialize the driver.

## Fingerprint Driver Listing
Some examples of external USB fingerprint readers that have ARM64 compatible drivers:
- :white_check_mark: ELAN (SECK, etc)
- :x: Macroarray WBDI (Arcanite, etc)
